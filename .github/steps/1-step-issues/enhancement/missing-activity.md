# üö® Missing Activity: GitHub Skills

The GitHub Skills activity announced by our principal is missing from the school activities signup page.

Yesterday in the school assembly, the principal announced a new partnership with GitHub to teach students practical coding and collaboration skills. However, when I try to sign up for this activity, I can't find it on the website.

I can see several other activities, like these, so I think I have access.

- ‚úÖ Chess Club
- ‚úÖ Programming Class
- ‚úÖ Gym Class

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline

This is time-sensitive as the announcement mentioned registrations would close by the end of this week. Many students are eager to join. It's the first part of our [GitHub Certifications program](https://resources.github.com/learn/certifications/), which will help with college applications.

## üí° Expected Outcome

The GitHub Skills activity should be added to the system and available for registration like other activities
